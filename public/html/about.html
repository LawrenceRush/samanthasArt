            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> “But I gotta use words when I talk to you.”-T.S. Elliot
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Beach-based artist Samantha Minear uses her paintings and drawings to communicate the things we keep
                hidden within ourselves. Working primarily in pastel and oil paint, she uses symbolism and childhood
                toys and objects to depict her rich inner world that started as a quiet child and has changed and
                adapted to this day.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha grew up in Southern California and graduated from California State University Long Beach in
                2004 with a Master’s of Fine Arts degree. While in school, she studied primarily with Domenic Cretara
                and became deeply influenced by his love for drawing, the figure, and art history. In her own work, she
                continues the rich realistic training and education she learned but imbues it with a feminine
                perspective.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work has been exhibited at many traditional spaces and galleries such as the Brea Art Gallery and
                the Triton Art museum as well as the Baton Rogue Gallery. Samantha has also chosen to show her work in
                non-traditional spaces as well such as pop-up galleries around Long Beach, churches, and at John Wayne
                Airport. She has taught all over Southern California and is currently teaching at Fullerton College and
                Cerritos College.</p>
